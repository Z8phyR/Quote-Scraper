# Quotes Scraper

This script scrapes famous quotes from the website [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com) and saves them to a JSON file for offline usage.

## Features

- Scrapes quotes and their authors from the first three pages of the website.
- Stores the scraped data in a structured JSON format.
- Uses politeness policy by waiting 2 seconds between requests to not overload the server.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The script is written in Python.
- **Requests**: A simple HTTP library for Python used to make requests to the website.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, used for web scraping tasks.
- **JSON**: Used for storing the scraped data in a structured format for later usage.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. After the script has run, you'll find a `quotes.json` file in the same directory. This file contains the scraped quotes.

## Important Notes

- This script is intended for educational purposes. Before scraping any website, always refer to the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure you're allowed to scrape it.
- Avoid making rapid, consecutive requests to websites. Always implement delays and respect the website's rate limits.
